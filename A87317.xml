            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEfore God of late of his Infinite Mercie was seen in the Mount of our Extreamities, turning our now Captivitie (in some sort) as rivers in the South, leaping by the mountaines, and skipping by the hills of our sinnes, flying upon the wings of the winde for our Beleefe; in so wonderfull a manner, as praised be his Name, now appeares. Many Engines were used by all appearance, to subvert and overthrow, the Liberties both of this Church and State; whilst the sonnes of <hi>Beliall</hi> (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Instruments) left no meanes un-attempted, whereby they might both openly assault, and (failling that) privately undermine and roote out the Power and life of godlinesse, yea, even under shew of love ayming at the overthrow of Religion, under pretence of freindship and brotherly love: as <hi>Jacob</hi> in the death of <hi>Abner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ayming to effect so strong a designe (as appeareth since was then in some of their heads) this in show was a strong <hi>Catholicon</hi> Ingredient, in their secret Counsells, so far as they might or were in hope to Prevaile with any; <hi>That Poporde was no Idolatri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Iust <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Policie, which God scourged with the overthrow of him and his posteritie: for sure his Calfes worship, was by God himself both so pronounced and punished in him and his. And I hope any reasonable men may suppose, that their is the same Idolatrie, If not greater, in falling down before a peece of bread, then was in worshiping a living Calfe which the Egyptians Adored, and in Imitation whereof, both <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Israelits before him made their golden Calfes, for which they suffered their severall punishments.</p>
            <p>For manie, yeares together holy Ministers first were disgraced, discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, suppressed, Imprisonned, occasionally, they their wives and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, starved and famished, for any reliefe they had from them, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifices sequestred, for not subscription unto catching cruell Articles of their own Invention, made to entrap, ensnare, keepe forth and thrust forth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable and holy Ministers out of their livings and habitations, this way to their power, dishartning, over-awing and keeping down, the vigorou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, such men were onely put in entrusted for the most to preach at Court‚ñ™ <hi>Pauls,</hi> with all such open places before Authoritie and multitudes, as would Cry down Preaching and Exalt Prayer (strict helpers to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and what Prayers? Common Prayer I warrant you (their then <hi>Diana</hi>) for Pulpit Sermon prayers suffered and were tortured with preaching it self, and the frequency thereof. And herein those men entrusted to preach openly &amp; before Authority; all ways choosed some such Texts wherein they jerked both thestrictness of Religion it selfs ralled at its best Preachers, condemning all of them as factious seditious men, perturbers of the State, &amp; withstanders of Authority, because they would not, durst not, or could not in Conscience, subscribe and yeild unto their Fooleries and Ceremonies. Though otherwise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But no wonder it was, when all of them were ruled by one or a few, who had it seemed so strictly besieged all Religious strongest holds and forts, that all went wrong; endeavouring to poyson the Fountaines of Authority, so to wind all, that they did what they listed: and so Religion had extreamly suffered, had not God been seen in the Mount of our extreamities, infatuating and taking (as usually his custome is) such men to fall by their own counsells. Whereby now the whole Body of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, with all theirs, are in danger to suffer, though their were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, many holy learned, mercifull, pious, discreet and wise men, free from the death of the Councels devices‚ñ™ and imaginations of these ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders‚ñ™ wishing things might have been carried to have runne in a more smooth and milde current.

            <p>And truely, it appeares that these famous worthies who first reformed this Church, (some of them after that proving Martyr-Bishops) when they left these Ceremonies lately in the Church, doing a way others, never thought or imagined either to have retained them so long, or that they should have beene made snares or baits to catch good Ministers in, keepe out some, put others forth, and worser in their places, and to have proved the causes of so many fierce contentions and oppositions for so many yeares since.</p>
            <p>For in that Preface unto their Service Booke: Authorized by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Sixth, they to this purpose write. <hi>We have not in abolishing of other Ceremonies and leaving of these, done the same for any holinesse, worth, or use, we have or imagine to make of them, more then of the residue abolished; or for any purpose we have still to reteine the same, but in time to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherein so blockish were some of them as to restraine Preaching under pretext, <hi>That one Sermon a day was enough, and more then any man could practise in many yeares together:</hi> the Refutation of which grosse errour, produced now this short discourse, to shew, <hi>both the excellency and necessity of often Hearing and Preaching:</hi> and to confute these prophane <hi>Ignor amuses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A wonder it is, that for the supportation of the life of grace, in that which shrould cherish the Immortall soule, in its wonderfull actings, To Fore see, pevent, gathertogether, multiply, survey, conclude, invent, purpose, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, discourse, choose, refuse, resolve, judge and determine of all things Rationally, dwelling in the darke Prison of a lumpish Body (good for nothing without it) where it hath so manie hinderances and lets, besides its naturall depravation untill Illuminated that heereunto they are contented to allow only one meale a weake and day; when they can allow the body constantly two meales sometimes three every day, not understanding, <hi>The ends, right use and causes, of often and freequent Preaching and Hearing,</hi> which are <hi>Three,</hi> and wherewith I will conclude.</p>
            <p>First for <hi>Conversion,</hi> in which case, untill <hi>Illumination,</hi> we are just like unto that impotent man, who lay so long at the poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> waiting when the Spirit of grace, will so blow by some of the Angel Ministers, as that we may be Converted. In which case what is not, to day, this weeke,
<pb facs="tcp:116314:5"/>weeks, a moneth, moneths, a yeare, yeares, yea in many yeares effected: yet may come to passe at length: so as men must wait still, when the winde of he Spirit will blow with the means, and so trouble the muddy waters of our corruptions, (throwing us into the Poole of Regeneration) as Conversion may be wrought. For which cause hearers must waite, and <hi>heare the word in season and out of season, as Ministers are bound to Preach the same:</hi> And the more the better, untill Christ by the Newbirth, may see of the travell of his soule and be satisfied: that he thereby be formed in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, being Newborne, we must not now stand still, but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, from faith to faith, and grace to grace, untill we come unto a perfect man in Christ, in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the New Creature: to be built up in that riches of understanding spoken of, so to put on the Lord Jesus in all his holy vertues, being transformed into his Image from glory to glory, to be as like him as may be. For this cause also, the word cannot be to often and frequently preached and Heard, both in season and out of season, to be built up daily more and more in Heavenly knowledge unto life everlasting, to be fully Sanctified and endowed with a great deal of grace here, that thereby we may be so much the fitter vessells, prepared for so much the more glory.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, our fraile house of Clay &amp;c. Wherein the Immortall soule hath its habitation here, the life of grace thereof must still be kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: we have backslidings, and are to encounter with many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Troubles, Vexations, Discouragements, having many Spirituall diseases to be cured: as Satan is cunning to assualt us full of trouble. And also the soule is to be kept in Spirituall life, courage and vigour, which not one or many dayes hearing can effect: to make up the every day miseries of our life renewed from day to day which we are sure and forced to encounter with. This daily and often Preaching effects, to Cure, Mitigate, Answer, and heale daily, all our Spirituall diseases and doubtings, quickning our dulnesse to helpe the life of Faith, encrease, maintaine, and renew our comforts, to keepe them alwaies upon the winge as it were, to cheere, encourage and harten us on in our Spirituall Journey homewards. So that having so many enemies, difficulties, temptations and troubles, to encounter with from the world, the flesh and the Devill: and the surmountingly glorious fabrique of of the New Creature to erect and build up as neere as may be in its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Excellency and Eminency; we cannot upon all occasions, either heare too much or too often, neither (as some think) can their be too much Preaching, which by the assistance and push of the Spirit, during all our life time, and daily, hath all these and many more wonders to worke: all which I hope willbe sufficient for <hi>Ignoramu's Conviction.</hi>
